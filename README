    Log::Any::Adapter -- Tell Log::Any where to send its logs

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
        use Log::Any::Adapter;

        # Use Log::Log4perl for all categories
        #
        Log::Log4perl::init('/etc/log4perl.conf');
        Log::Any::Adapter->set('Log4perl');

        # Use Log::Dispatch for Foo::Baz
        #
        use Log::Dispatch;
        my $log = Log::Dispatch->new(outputs => [[ ... ]]);
        Log::Any::Adapter->set( { category => 'Foo::Baz' },
            'Dispatch', dispatcher => $log );

        # Use Log::Dispatch::Config for Foo::Baz and its subcategories
        #
        use Log::Dispatch::Config;
        Log::Dispatch::Config->configure('/path/to/log.conf');
        Log::Any::Adapter->set(
            { category => qr/^Foo::Baz/ },
            'Dispatch', dispatcher => Log::Dispatch::Config->instance() );

        # Use your own adapter for all categories
        #
        Log::Any::Adapter->set('+My::Log::Any::Adapter', ...);

DESCRIPTION
    The `Log-Any-Adapter' distribution implements Log::Any class methods to
    specify where logs should be sent. It is a separate distribution so as
    to keep `Log::Any' itself as simple and unchanging as possible.

    You do not have to use anything in this distribution explicitly. It will
    be auto-loaded when you call one of the methods below.

ADAPTERS
    In order to use a logging mechanism with `Log::Any', there needs to be
    an adapter class for it. Typically this is named
    Log::Any::Adapter::*something*.

    The following adapters are available on CPAN as of this writing:

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Log4perl - work with log4perl

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch - work with Log::Dispatch or
        Log::Dispatch::Config

    You may also find other adapters on CPAN by searching for
    "Log::Any::Adapter", or create your own adapter. See
    Log::Any::Adapter::Development for more information on the latter.

SETTING AND REMOVING ADAPTERS
    Log::Any::Adapter->set ([options, ]adapter_name, adapter_params...)
        This method sets the adapter to use for all log categories, or for a
        particular set of categories.

        *adapter_name* is the name of an adapter. It is automatically
        prepended with "Log::Any::Adapter::". If instead you want to pass
        the full name of an adapter, prefix it with a "+". e.g.

            # Use My::Adapter class
            Log::Any::Adapter->set('+My::Adapter', arg => $value);

        *adapter_params* are passed along to the adapter constructor. See
        the documentation for the individual adapter classes for more
        information.

        An optional hash of *options* may be passed as the first argument.
        Options are:

        category
            A string containing a category name, or a regex (created with
            qr//) matching multiple categories. If not specified, all
            categories will be affected.

        lexically
            A reference to a lexical variable. When the variable goes out of
            scope, the adapter setting will be removed. e.g.

                {
                    Log::Any::Adapter->set({lexically => \my $lex}, ...);

                    # in effect here
                    ...
                }
                # no longer in effect here

        `set' returns an entry object, which can be passed to `remove'.

    Log::Any::Adapter->remove (entry)
        Remove an *entry* previously returned by `set'.

MULTIPLE ADAPTER SETTINGS
    `Log::Any' maintains a stack of entries created via `set'.

    When you get a logger for a particular category, `Log::Any' will work
    its way down the stack and use the first matching entry.

    Whenever the stack changes, any `Log::Any' loggers that have previously
    been created will automatically adjust to the new stack. For example:

        my $log = Log::Any->get_logger();
        $log->error("aiggh!");   # this goes nowhere
        ...
        {
            Log::Any::Adapter->set({ local => \my $lex }, 'Log4perl');
            $log->error("aiggh!");   # this goes to log4perl
            ...
        }
        $log->error("aiggh!");   # this goes nowhere again
